This **Geospatial Python** course teaches you the basic concepts of programming and scientific data analysis using the Python programming language in a format that is easy to learn and understand (no previous programming experience required). Each lesson is a tutorial with specific topic(s) where the aim is to gain skills and understanding how to solve common data-related tasks using Python. The course has been developed jointly by the Master's Program in Geography and the Bachelor's Program in Geoscience at the University of Helsinki, and has been adapted for learning on the DASH Databricks platform under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode).

Geo-Python covers the essential skills needed to continue to the more advanced course on [Automating GIS processes](/mm-starter/learning-and-development/pathways/auto-gis).

**Open Access!**

The course is **open for everyone to follow online**. The aim of this course is to share the knowledge and help people to get started with their journey towards doing science more efficiently and in a reproducible manner using Python programming.

## Course format

The majority of this course will be spent in front of a computer learning to program in the Python language. The course consists of interactive lectures and weekly exercises. The exercises will focus on developing basic programming skills using Python and applying those skills to various analytical problems. Typical exercises will involve a brief introduction followed by topical computer-based tasks. You are encouraged to discuss and work together with other learners using the discussions section of the course material [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tomkdefra/geo-python-notebooks) while working on the exercises.

## Course topics

After completing this course, learners will (1) understand basic programming concepts, (2) be able to write short programs, and (3) manipulate, analyse, and visualise scientific data using Python. Learners will also learn to use version control (git) and online repositories (GitHub) for documenting and sharing their work. Themes for each week are listed below. You can also read more about the weekly [learning goals](course-info/learning-goals).

The course runs for seven weeks in the autumn semester starting on the 4th of September 2023. New materials are updated on this course page each Monday.

**Step by step instructions with cloud computing!**

The materials are presented in a way that you can follow them step by step exactly as they are written, as long as you use the cloud computing resources that we provide for you (namely JupyterLab Notebooks using Binder or CSC Cloud computing resources). If you would like, you can find [more information about our cloud computing environment](lessons/L1/course-environment-components). For those planning to work on the course materials on your own computer, please note that you will **need to adjust the file paths to the data** accordingly.

**For teachers**

If you would like to use these materials for your own teaching or develop them further, we highly support that. Please read more about how to do it from [our licensing terms](course-info/licensing).
