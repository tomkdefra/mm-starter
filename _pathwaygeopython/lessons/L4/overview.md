# Lesson overview

In this lesson we will learn how to create and use functions, one of the
most powerful concepts in programming. A
`function (funktio)`{.interpreted-text role="term"} makes it easy to use
and re-use of a part of a program. We will also introduce you to the
concept of a `module (moduuli)`{.interpreted-text role="term"} (also
known as a `library (ohjelmakirjasto)`{.interpreted-text role="term"} in
other programming languages), which you can think of as a toolbox for a
specific purpose. Each module contains specific functionalities (i.e.,
functions) that you can use for different tasks. Thus, functions and
modules are closely related.

In this lesson, we also review the use of AI and LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) in
generating code and discuss the pros and cons. The main components of
today\'s lesson can be found in the navigation bar to the left.

## Learning goals

After this weeks lesson your should be able to:

-   Explain how functions are used and their benefits
-   Describe the pros and cons of using AI and LLM in generating code
-   Create your own functions to calculate an output value based on an
    input value
-   Save functions to a script file for future use
