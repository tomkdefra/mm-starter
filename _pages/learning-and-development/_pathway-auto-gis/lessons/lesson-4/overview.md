# Overview

In this lesson, we will get to know how geopandas handles some typical GIS
operations: **overlay analysis** (e.g., unions, or differences of multiple
geometries), **aggregating** geometries (e.g., smaller statistical units into
larger ones), **simplifying** geometries (to be printed or shown at smaller map
scales), and **classifying** numerical data into categories for map display. 


## Learning goals

After this lesson, you should know how to:

- create new geometries by adding, subtracting or intersecting two geometries,
- combine geometries based on a common attribute (*dissolving* them),
- create categories for numerical data based on classifiers such as *natural
  breaks*, *equal interval*, or *quantiles*, and
- simplify geometries according to a maximum-error threshold
