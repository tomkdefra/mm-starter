## Instructor-led training

### Induction training

We encourage all new users to attend an induction training session, which lasts 1 hour and consists of an overview of the platform followed by a demonstration of the various tools available.

We hold two induction training sessions each month, on the first Tuesday (morning) and the third Thursday (afternoon) of each month. Please note that "Click along" is very much encouraged. Please follow the links below to sign up to training in 2024.
