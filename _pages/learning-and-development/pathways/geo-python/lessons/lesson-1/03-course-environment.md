During this course, we will use different tools and applications for
programming and communications:

1.  [Databricks](#Databricks) for the actual programming
2.  [Git and GitHub](#git-and-github) for version control, documentation and discussion


## Databricks

[Databricks](https://Databricks.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)
is an open-source web-based user interface for doing data science. The
Databricks interface consists of different components such as a file
browser, terminal, image viewer, console, text editor, etc.

**Databricks Notebooks** (filename extension `.ipynb`) are documents inside
the Databricks environment which contain computer code, and rich text
elements (figures, links, etc.). Databricks Notebooks are perfect for
documenting a data science workflow in an interactive format.

**We use Databricks Notebooks as the default programming
environment during this course.** All of the course materials are
available in a Databricks setting via [cloud computing
environments](#cloud-computing-environments).

## Git and GitHub

One of the core goals of this course (besides learning programming) is
to learn how to use [version
control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) with
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) and storing your
code (privately) on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) is a version control
software (developed by a rather famous Finn named Linus Torvalds - he
also created Linux!) that is used to track and store changes in your
files (often source code for programs) without losing the history of
past changes. Files in Git are stored in a repository, which you can
simply think of as a directory containing files (or other directories)
related to a single 'project'. Git is widely used by professionals to
keep track of what they've done and to collaborate with other people.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web based Git repository hosting
service and social network. It is the largest online storage space of
collaborative works that exists in the world. It is a place where you
can share your code openly to the entire world or alternatively only to
your collaborators working on the same project. GitHub provides a nice
web-interface to your files that is easy to use. It is a nice way for
exploring the codes and documentation or e.g., teaching materials such
as those in our course.

Both Git and GitHub provide many more features than the ones mentioned
here, but for now we are happy to understand the basic idea of what they
are.

## Page summary

Now you should have (at least) a basic idea about the different
components of our course environment and what they mean. You don't need
to understand everything fully at this point as they will become clearer
when we start using the course environment.
