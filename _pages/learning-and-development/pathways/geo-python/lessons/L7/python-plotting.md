Python has many nice, useful libraries that can be used for plotting. In
the figure above, you can see a number of the available plotting library
options, along with how they relate to one another. Of the options
above, we would like to highlight:

-   [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Matplotlib is one of the most
    widely used Python plotting libraries, sometimes referred to as
    \"\*the grand old man of Python plotting\*\". Plot examples can be
    found in the [Matplotlib
    gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html).
    -   [Matplotlib Basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/index.html):
        The Matplotlib Basemap Toolkit is a plugin for visualizing maps
        in Python. Example plots available in the [Matplotlib basemap
        gallery](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/examples.html).
        **Note**: The Matplotlib Basemap project is being depricated in
        favor of [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/)
        ([Cartopy
        gallery](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/gallery/index.html)).
    -   [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): Seaborn is a high-level
        interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics that is
        built on top of Matplotlib. Example plots can be found in the
        [Seaborn
        gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html).
-   [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/): Bokeh is a modern
    plotting library for static and interactive web-based plots
    including graphs, maps, and charts. Examples can be found in the
    [Bokeh gallery](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html).
-   [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/): Similar in some ways to Bokeh,
    Plotly is a modern plotting library for static and interactive
    web-based plots. Some features are commercial. Example plots are
    available in the [Plotly
    gallery](https://plotly.com/python/basic-charts/).
-   [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/): Dash is a Python framework for
    building analytical web applications. No JavaScript required.
-   [ggplot](https://yhat.github.io/ggpy/): ggplot is a Python plotting
    environment for those familiar with creating plots in R using
    ggplot2. You can use ggplot in Python too! Plot examples can be
    found in the [(ggplot examples)](https://yhat.github.io/ggpy/).
-   [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/) and
    [GeoViews](https://geoviews.org/): HoloViews and GeoViews aim to let
    the data visualize itself. Learn more in the [HoloViews introductory
    video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNsR2H7Lrg0).
    -   Modern and powerful visualization libraries built on top of
        Matplotlib and Bokeh that makes exploring and visualizing your
        data quicker than ever before
    -   HoloViews is designed for basic plotting ([HoloViews
        tutorial](https://holoviews.org/Tutorials/index.html) and
        [HoloViews examples](https://holoviews.org/Examples/index.html))
    -   GeoViews is designed for creating nice and interactive maps
        ([GeoViews gallery](https://geoviews.org/gallery/index.html))

Explore the galleries and examples of different visualization libraries
above to learn what\'s possible to do in Python.

As you can see from the examples, the plotting possibilities in Python
are numerous and rich. Do you need to know them all? Of course not. Not
even we do. It is not even reasonable to use them all. Instead you
should start by learning to use one that suits your needs and then later
extend your knowledge and skills to other visualization libraries when
necessary.

In the Automating GIS processes II course we will be learning a bit of
some other plotting libraries not used in the Geo-Python/AutoGIS I
course.
