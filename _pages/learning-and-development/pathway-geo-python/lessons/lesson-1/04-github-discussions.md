GitHub Discussions allows community interaction within a project's repository or organisation. It helps maintainers, contributors, and visitors engage in conversations, share announcements, gather feedback, ask questions, and create polls. Discussions can be organised using categories, sections, and labels for better management and visibility.

## Key Features

- **Conversations**: Enable threaded discussions for collaboration.
- **Polls**: Gauge community opinion.
- **Categories**: Organise discussions by topics.
- **Labels**: Tag discussions for easier navigation.
- **Moderation**: Pin, lock, or convert issues to discussions.
