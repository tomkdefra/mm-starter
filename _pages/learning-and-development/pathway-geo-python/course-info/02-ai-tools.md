Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools using large language models
(AI-LLMs), such as Claude, ChatGPT, or Google Bard, are changing the ways
in which people produce content including software. Although these tools
have great potential to expidite many coding tasks, it is important to
note that one must understand the code that is produced in order to
ensure it functions properly. As the goal of the Geo-Python course is to
introduce both basic programming concepts and how to write code using
the Python programming language, learners should be careful to
ensure the use of AI tools does not compromise the learning goals of the
course.

## Guidelines for AI-LLM use in the Civil Service

More information on using AI-LLMs in your work can be found in the [Generative AI Framework for HMG](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-ai-framework-for-hmg/generative-ai-framework-for-hmg-html)
