# Lesson overview

This week we will focus on repeating tasks and making decisions in
Python. Both of these concepts are part of the larger computing idea
called *control flow*, which refers to how the execution of different
parts of a computer program is determined. We will learn how to alter
the execution of our notebooks using (1) *loops*, which are used to
repeat execution of parts of a program, and (2) *conditional
statements*, which use basic logical tests to determine which parts of a
program will be run. The main components of today\'s lesson can be found
in the navigation bar to the left.

## Learning goals

After this weeks lesson your should be able to:

-   Create a `for` loop and use it to repeat a section of code
-   Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions in your
    programs
-   Explain how values can be compared using comparison operators
