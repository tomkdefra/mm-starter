## [Data Science and Statistics Learning Pathway](/mm-starter/learning-and-development/pathways/data-science-and-statistics)

A structured pathway to develop skills in data analysis, statistical methods, and data science techniques.

## [Automating GIS Processes](/mm-starter/learning-and-development/pathways/auto-gis)

A master's level course in using Python to automate common geospatial work. Developed at the Department of Geosciences and Geography, University of Helsinki, Finland, and adapted for learning on the DASH Databricks platform. 

## [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines Learning Pathway](/mm-starter/learning-and-development/pathways/raps)

This learning journey will help participants gain the tools to create Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP), a key part of producing high quality outputs. Participants will learn how to use important components of RAP in Python and R, improving their programming skills. Participants are expected to have a working knowledge of Python or R for data analysis already.
