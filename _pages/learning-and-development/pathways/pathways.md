## [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines Learning Pathway](/mm-starter/learning-and-development/pathways/raps)

This learning journey will help participants gain the tools to create Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP), a key part of producing high quality outputs. Participants will learn how to use important components of RAP in Python and R, improving their programming skills. Participants are expected to have a working knowledge of Python or R for data analysis already.
