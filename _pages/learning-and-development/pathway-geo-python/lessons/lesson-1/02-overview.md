Today we will have our first taste of programming in Python. In order to
start learning Python, however, we need to introduce you how we will
work during the course using different tools including a dedicated
computing environment, which is based on the principles of [cloud
computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing). This first
tutorial will introduce you to the basic components of the course
environment, guide you through how they are used, and conclude with a
hands-on introduction to some key concepts and elements of programming
in Python. The main components of today's lesson can be found in the
navigation bar to the left.

**Note:** There is a lot of material here but don't worry, you will become
familiar with all of these things once we start working in practice.
