# Meet Git

This tutorial covers the very basics of version control using Git and
GitHub. These materials have been adapted for the Geo-Python course from
the [GitHub Education Campus Advisors
resources](https://github.com/Campus-Advisors), and [Git
documentation](https://git-scm.com/about/).

After this lesson you should be able to do these steps in JupyterLab
using git and the JupyterLab git-plugin:

1.  [Clone a repository from GitHub](#clone-a-repository-from-github)
2.  [Add changes](#add-changes)
3.  [Commit changes](#commit-changes)
4.  [Push changes to GitHub](#push-changes-to-github)

These steps can be completed either using the [JupyterLab git
plugin](#jupyterlab-git-plugin) (we recommend this option for beginners)
or using [Git from the command line](#git-from-the-command-line).

## Key concepts

We use Git to record changes to our files over time, and for
communicating between the local repository on our computer and the
remote repository on GitHub. A \"repository\", or a \"Git project\", or
a \"repo\", is a location for storing files. A repo contains all the
files and folders associated with a project and the revision history of
each entity. In general, it is recommended that each project, library or
discrete piece of software should have it\'s own repository. For
example, each exercise in this course has it\'s own repository on
GitHub.

During this course, we often start by cloning an existing repository
from GitHub to our own computer using `git clone`. Using `git pull` we
can fetch (and merge) new changes from GitHub, and `git push` publishes
our local changes to GitHub. [Read more about sharing and updating Git
projects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C:-Git-Commands-Sharing-and-Updating-Projects).

<figcaption>Update your Git project using the pull and push commands.
Always pull before you push (especially when working in a shared
project)!</figcaption>
</figure>

The version control history consists of snapshots of all the files in
our project. In order record changes to our files, we first add changes
to a so called staging area (using the command `git add`). The idea is,
that you can have a (sometimes messy) working directory, and by using
`git add` you tell Git which files to include in the next committed
snapshot. Finally, the command `git commit` records a permanent snapshot
of the staged changes. [Read more about basic
snapshotting](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C:-Git-Commands-Basic-Snapshotting).

## Preparations

Let\'s go through the basics of using Git. We will use Exercise-1
repository created last week to practice. Before we start, open a new
JupyterLab session if you do not already have one open.

You can find instructions for using Binder and CSC Notebooks in
`Lesson 1 materials <../../L1/course-environment-components>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

### Create a Personal Access Token

Before we start cloning our repository from GitHub, we need to create a
Personal Access Token for us to be able to interact with GitHub. We will
go through the basic setup here, but you can find more detailed
instructions in the [GitHub
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

1.  If you have not already verified your email address, make sure to do
    so in your GitHub settings ([GitHub email
    verification](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/verifying-your-email-address)).
    On GitHub, go into your settings.

    ![image](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/settings/userbar-account-settings.png){width="200px"}

2.  Click on **Developer settings** in the left sidebar.

3.  Click on **Personal access tokens**.

4.  Click on **Tokens (classic)**.

5.  We will create the token by clicking on **Generate new token** and
    then **Generate new token (classic)**.

    -   If you are using two-factor authentication, you may be prompted
        to enter an authentication code at this point.

6.  We can start by giving our token a name in under **Note**.

    ![image](img/token_name.png){width="500px"}

7.  We can then give the token an expiration date. You can choose the
    duration you prefer, but it would be best to set it to at least the
    end of the year.

    ![image](img/token_expiration.png){width="300px"}

8.  Now we need to set the permissions, or scopes, that our token is
    granted. We are going to need it to be able to access and change our
    exercise repositories. For that, we can select the check boxes for
    **repo**, **admin:repo_hook**, and **delete_repo**.

    ![image](img/token_scopes.png){width="500px"}

9.  At this point we can click the **Generate token** button to create
    and see our token.

10. We are then presented with our Personal access token, click the copy
    button to copy it to your clipboard and then paste it into a text
    file in the JupyterLab session.

    -   Open a text document and copy and paste your Personal access
        token in a text file, because for now we are going to use it
        like this, and we will later see how we can cache it so that we
        don\'t need to copy and paste it every time we need it. If your
        access token is ever lost, you can just follow the steps above
        again to create a new one.

Now that we have created a personal access token, the next thing we need
is the URL of your exercise repository from GitHub. **Go to**
<https://github.com/geo-python-2023/> **and navigate to your personal
Exercise-1 repository.**

On GitHub, find the button **Code** and copy the url under *HTTPS*.

The URL looks something like this:
<https://github.com/Geo-Python-2023/exercise-1-davewhipp.git> but with
your own username or team name.

## JupyterLab git plugin

### Clone a repository from GitHub

During this course, we will most often start working with the exercises
using an existing repository from GitHub. In order to get a copy of the
exercise repository on our own computer (or the cloud computer), we need
to `clone` it.

Navigate to the **my-work** folder in JupyterLab, create a new folder
inside it called **exercises**, and double-click to enter that folder.
Next, activate the git-plugin. The plugin will tell you that
**exercises** is not a Git repository and gives you some options.

In our case, we want to **Clone a Repository**:

![](img/git-plugin-start-cloning.png)

Go ahead and paste your exercise repository URL into the pop-up window:

![](img/git-plugin-clone.png)

On the command line this action is equivalent to the `git clone`
command.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

**Pay attention to which folder you are in!** Git will create a new
folder under the folder you are located in when cloning a repo.
::::

### Credentials

Git needs to know who you are in order to give you access to remote
repositories.

**Insert your GitHub username and personal access token**:

![](img/git-plugin-credentials.png)

Now you should see a new folder in JupyterLab that is identical to the
repository on GitHub.

On the command line, credentials can be managed using `git config`.

### Git status

Navigate to the new folder in JupyterLab and activate the Git plugin.
You should now see some basic info about your repository:

![](img/git-plugin-status1.png)

On the command line `git status` shows the status of the repository.

### Add changes

Let\'s start making changes in the repository! Open the `README.md` file
and make some edits. For example, add some text at the end of the file:

<figure>
<img src="img/edit-readme.png" width="750" alt="img/edit-readme.png" />
<figcaption>Edit a file in JupyterLab</figcaption>
</figure>

After saving your changes, check the status of the repository. You
should see `README.md` listed under **Changed** files:

<figure>
<img src="img/git-plugin-changed.png" width="350"
alt="img/git-plugin-changed.png" />
<figcaption>Changes visible in the Git plugin</figcaption>
</figure>

These changes are not yet \"staged for commit\", which means that we
need to add them first to the staging area if we want to make a
permanent snapshot of these changes.

![](img/git-plugin-stage-changes.png){width="350px"}

After adding the changes, you should see the changed file under
**Staged** in the Git plugin.

Note that you can also **unstage** and **discard changes** using the
plugin. For now, we are happy with the changes made, and are ready to
commit them.

On the command line, `git add` is the command for adding changes to the
staging area.

### Commit changes

Once the changed files are in the staging area, we can create a
permanent snapshot by committing the changes. Always remember to write
an informative commit message to accompany your changes:

![](img/git-plugin-commit.png){width="300px"}

Once you hit the commit button, the plugin will most likely ask your
name and email.

![](img/git-commit-credentials.png)

You can insert the same details you used when signing up to GitHub.

![](img/git-plugin-commit-ok.png)

Once the commit succeeds, you should see the latest set of changes under
the History tab in the Git plugin:

![](img/git-plugin-history1.png)

*Note: You might also see some previous changes by the course
instructors. These changes have been generated automatically and you can
ignore them.*

On the command line the syntax for committing is
`git commit -m "commit message"`. After committing, it is good practice
to check the repository status using `git status`.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

We can **tell Git to remember our GitHub username and access token** to
avoid typing them in all the time. Open up a Terminal window and type in
this command:

`git config --global credential.helper 'store --file /home/jovyan/my-work/.git-credentials'`

Then change the folder you are in by typing (with your username):

`cd exercises/exercise-1-davewhipp/`

We then pull from our GitHub repository:

`git pull`

Type your username, press enter, and go to the text file with your
access token, copy it, and paste into your terminal with **Ctrl** +
**v** and press **Enter**. Then your username and access token should be
stored and you can pull and push to and from GitHub without having to
type your access token every time.
::::

### Push changes to GitHub

Next, we want to synchronize our local changes with the remote
repository on GitHub.

<figure>
<img src="img/git-plugin-pull-push-buttons.png"
alt="img/git-plugin-pull-push-buttons.png" />
<figcaption>Buttons for Pulling and Pushing changes between the local
and remote repositories</figcaption>
</figure>

First, it\'s good to use `git pull` (button with arrow down) to double
check for remote changes before contributing your own changes.

![](img/git-plugin-pull-ok.png)

In this case, the repository is probably up-to-date and no new changes
are downloaded. However, it is good practice to always use git pull
before publishing your local changes in case someone made changes in the
remote repository in the meanwhile!

Now we are ready to push the local changes to GitHub using `git push`
(button with arrow up):

![](img/git-plugin-push-ok.png)

Now you should see the updates in GitHub! Go and have a look at your
personal repository in <https://github.com/Geo-Python-2023/> .

On the command line, `git pull` fetches and merges changes from the
remote repository, and `git pull` publishes local changes.

That\'s all you need to know about Git for now :)

## Git from the command line

There are many different ways of using Git, and you might want to try
out using Git from the command line at some point.

### Terminal

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You will need to know a couple of basic command line commands in order
to use Git from the command line. Code Academy\'s [list of command line
commands](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands)
provides a good overview of commonly used commands for navigating trough
files on the command line. For using Git on the command line, you should
at least be familiar with these commands:

-   `ls` - list contents of the current directory
-   `ls -a` - list contents of the current directory including hidden
    files
-   `cd` - change directory. For example, `cd exercises`
-   `cd ..` - move one directory up
::::

**Start a new Terminal session in JupyterLab** using the icon on the
Launcher, or from *File* \> *New* \> *Terminal*.

![](img/terminal-icon.png)

**Check if you have git installed** by typing `git --version` in the
terminal window:

``` bash
git --version
```

Anything above version 2 is just fine.

:::: note

You can paste text on the terminal using `Ctrl + V` or
`Shift + Right Click --> paste`
::::

### Configuring Git credentials

Configure Git to remember your identity using the `git config` tools.
You (hopefully) only need to do this once if working on your own
computer, or on a cloud computer with persistent storage on CSC
notebooks.

``` bash
git config --global user.name "[firstname lastname]"
git config --global user.email "[email@example.com]"
```

### Basic commands

The basic workflow of cloning a repository, adding changes to the
staging area, committing and pushing the changes can be completed using
these command line commands:

-   `git clone [url]` - retrieve a repository from a remote location
    (often from GitHub)
-   `git status`- review the status of your repository (use this command
    often!)
-   `git add [file]` - add files to the next commit (add files to the
    staging area)
-   `git commit -m "[descriptive message]"` - commit staged files as a
    new snapshot
-   `git pull` - bring the local branch up to date (fetch and merge
    changes from the remote)
-   `git push` - transmit local branch commits to the remote repository

Remember to use `git status` often to check the status of our
repository.

::: admonition
Other useful Git commands

Check out other commonly used git commands from [the GIT CHEAT
SHEET](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
:::

::: admonition
Remote repository

Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on a
network location (such as GitHub). When we cloned the repository using
`git clone`, Git automatically started tracking the remote repository
from where we cloned the project. You can use the `git remote -v`
command to double check which remote your repository is tracking.

**A common mistake during this course is that you have accidentally
cloned the template repository in stead of your own/your teams
repository.**

[Read more about managing
remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes).
:::

::: admonition
Main branch

**Branches and branching** are powerful features in Git that allow
maintaining parallel versions of the same project. During this course
you don\'t need to worry too much about branches. However, it is good to
understand that **we are working on the main branch of our repository**.
For example, when using the `git push` command, the full syntax is
`git push origin main` which means that we are pushing the changes to
the main branch of the remote repository called origin. [Read more about
git branches](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch).
:::

## Resolving conflicts

It is possible that you will encounter a **merge conflict** at some
point of this course. A merge conflict might happen if two users have
edited the same content, or if you yourself have edited the same content
both on GitHub and locally without properly synchronizing the changes.
In short, Git will tell you if it is not able to sort out the version
history of your project by announcing a merge conflict.

We won\'t cover how to solve merge conflicts in detail during the
lessons. You can read more about [how to resolve merge conflicts from
the Git
documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_how_to_resolve_conflicts).
**The best thing to do to avoid merge conflicts is to always Pull before
you Push new changes.** In case you encounter a merge conflict, don\'t
panic! Read carefully the message related to the merge conflict, and try
searching for a solution online and ask for help on Slack.

Remember that you can always download your files on your own computer,
and upload them manually to GitHub like we did in Exercise 1!
