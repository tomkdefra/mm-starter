This **Geospatial Python** course teaches the basic concepts of programming and scientific data analysis using the Python programming language in a format that is easy to learn and understand (no previous programming experience required). Each lesson is a tutorial with specific topic(s) where the aim is to gain skills and understanding how to solve common data-related tasks using Python. The course has been developed jointly by the Master's Program in Geography and the Bachelor's Program in Geoscience at the University of Helsinki, and has been adapted for learning on the DASH Databricks platform under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode).

Geo-Python covers the essential skills needed to continue to the more advanced course on [Automating GIS processes](/mm-starter/learning-and-development/pathways/auto-gis).

**Open Access!**

The course is **open for everyone to follow online**. The aim of this course is to share the knowledge and help people to get started with their journey towards doing science more efficiently and in a reproducible manner using Python programming.

## Course format

The majority of this course will be spent in front of a computer learning to program in the Python language. The course consists of interactive lectures and exercises. The exercises will focus on developing basic programming skills using Python and applying those skills to various analytical problems. Typical exercises will involve a brief introduction followed by topical computer-based tasks. You are encouraged to discuss and work together with other learners using the discussions section of the course material [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tomkdefra/geo-python-notebooks) while working on the exercises.

## Course topics

After completing this course, learners will (1) understand basic programming concepts, (2) be able to write short programs, and (3) manipulate, analyse, and visualise scientific data using Python. Learners will also learn to use version control (git) and online repositories (GitHub) for documenting and sharing their work. The adapted version of this course is self-paced, but the original themes for each week are listed below. You can also read more about the weekly [learning goals](course-info/learning-goals).
