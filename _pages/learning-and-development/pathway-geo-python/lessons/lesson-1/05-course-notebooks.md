# Forking and Cloning a GitHub Repository into Databricks

## Forking the Repository

A **fork** is a personal copy of someone else's repository that lives on your GitHub account. It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

To fork a repository, use the following link:
[Create a Fork](https://github.com/new?template_name=geo-python-notebooks&template_owner=tomkdefra)

1. Click the link above.
2. Fill in the required details for your new repository.
3. Click the "Create repository from template" button.

## Cloning Your Fork into Databricks

A **clone** is a copy of a repository that you manage on your local machine. Cloning is used to create a local working copy of a remote repository.

To clone your fork into Databricks, follow these steps:

1. Open your Databricks workspace.
2. Go to the Repos tab.
3. Click "Add Repo".
4. Select "Clone remote Git repo".
5. Enter the URL of your forked repository.
6. Click "Create".

Your forked repository will now be cloned into your Databricks workspace, allowing you to work with the notebooks and other files directly.
