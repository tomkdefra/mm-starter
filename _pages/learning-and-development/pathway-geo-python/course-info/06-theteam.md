The Geo-Python course has been produced by a [team](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course-info/theteam.html) of teachers, content
creators, and course assistants at the Department of Geosciences and Geography, University of Helsinki, Finland.

Their work is adapted and reproduced here with gratitude.
