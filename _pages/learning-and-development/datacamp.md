Reviews from current DataCamp users in Defra group:

“DataCamp has been a key tool in upskilling in Python from a standing start. The short instructional videos and subsequent practice with mini projects has allowed me to get to grips with the basics of coding and to quickly develop skills that I can use for real life projects. This has meant I've unlocked interesting areas such as natural language processing to work on and all in the space of a couple of months!” - Sam

“DataCamp has been a brilliant resource to improve my coding skills. I have been working through the ‘Data Scientist with R’ course, which goes through lots of helpful topics (starting with the basics) in an easy to understand and interactive way. The practice sessions and option to try out real-world projects are also really helpful and my coding skills have improved significantly as a result” - Gemma
