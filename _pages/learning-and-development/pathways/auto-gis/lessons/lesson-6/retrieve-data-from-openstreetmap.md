# Retrieving data from OpenStreetMap

## What is OpenStreetMap?

OpenStreetMap is a free and open map service, but - first and foremost - it is
a collaborative global effort to collect free and open geodata. *Source:
[wiki.openstreetmap.org](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Logos)*
:::

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a global collaborative (crowd-sourced) database and
project that aims at creating a free editable map of the world containing of
information about our environment. It contains data about streets, buildings,
different services, and landuse, to mention but a few.
The collected data is also basis for the map at [openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org/). 


:::{admonition} Contribute!
:class: note

You can also sign up as a contributor if you want to add to the database and
map or correct and improve existing data. Read more in the  [OpenStreetMap
Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page).
:::


OSM has more than 8 million registered users who contribute around 4 million
changes daily.  Its database contains data that is described by [more than 7
billion nodes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Stats) (that make up lines,
polygons and other objects).

While the most well-known side of OpenStreetMap is the map itself, that [we
have used as a background map](../lesson-5/static-maps), the project is much
more than that. OSMâ€™s data can be used for many other purposes such as
**routing**, **geocoding**, **education**, and **research**. OSM is also widely
used for humanitarian response, e.g., in crisis areas (e.g. after natural
disasters) and for fostering economic development. Read more about humanitarian
projects that use OSM data from the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM)
website](https://www.hotosm.org).



## Main tools in this lesson

### OSMnx

This week we will explore a Python package called
[OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) that can be used to retrieve street
networks from OpenStreetMap, and construct, analyse, and visualise them. OSMnx
can also fetch data about Points of Interest, such as restaurants, schools, and
different kinds of services.  The package also includes tools to find routes on
a network downloaded from OpenStreetMap, and implements algorithms for finding
shortest connections for walking, cycling, or driving.


To get an overview of the capabilities of the package, watch the introductory
video given by the lead developer of the package, Prof. Geoff Boeing: ["Meet
the developer: Introduction to OSMnx package by Geoff
Boeing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0uxu25ddc4&list=PLs9D4XVqc6dCAhhvhZB7aHGD8fCeCC_6N).

There is also a scientific article available describing the package:

> Boeing, G. 2017. ["OSMnx: New Methods for Acquiring, Constructing, Analyzing,
> and Visualizing Complex Street
> Networks."](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309738462_OSMnx_New_Methods_for_Acquiring_Constructing_Analyzing_and_Visualizing_Complex_Street_Networks)
> Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 65, 126-139.
> doi:10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2017.05.004

[This
tutorial](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/01-overview-osmnx.ipynb)
provides a practical overview of OSMnx functionalities, and has also inspired
this AutoGIS lesson.


### NetworkX

We will also use [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation//)
to manipulate and analyse the street network data retrieved from
OpenStreetMap. NetworkX is a Python package that can be used to create,
manipulate, and study the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex
networks.
