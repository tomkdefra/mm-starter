# Lesson overview

During this week, we will introduce you to data visualization and some
different modules that can be used to make data plots in Python. You can
create simple plots directly from [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/),
for example, but in order to control many aspects of those plots we need
to also know how to use the plotting module called
[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). Matplotlib is an extremely
powerful and flexible plotting module, as you will see.

## Learning goals

After this weeks lesson your should be able to:

-   Make basic *x*-*y* plots of data using pandas/Matplotlib
-   Manipulate plot formatting
-   Create plots in Jupyter notebooks and/or save them as image files
